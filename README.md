# CSS 3D Clickable Flip-Card Portfolio

A one-page portfolio built on the Stellar (HTML5 UP) template, featuring interactive flip-cards  
that showcase three of my Python projects. Each card flips over to reveal an overview,  
key features, tech stack, and a direct link to the GitHub repo.

## How It Works

- Pure CSS 3D perspective + `<input type="checkbox">` toggle  
- Fully responsive: flex-wrapped grid of cards  
- No JavaScript required for the flip itself
